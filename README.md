# Perseids 2020
This repository contains data for observations of the Perseids 2020 in the night 12-13 August 2020 above LOFAR, with various optical and radio instruments. This repository is very much a work in progress, as not all of the data has been processed.

The file [meteor-overview.csv](meteor-overview.csv) contains events detected with the various instruments, as to prioritize data reduction for the other instruments. The meaning of the numbers in this file is as follows:
 
 * 0: No detection
 * 1: Possible detection, or 'normal detection' for all sky camera
 * 2: Detection, or 'bright detection' for all sky camera
 * 3: Very bright detection
